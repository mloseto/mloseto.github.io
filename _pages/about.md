Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, Department of Economics. My primary area of interest lies at the intersection of
**industrial organization** and **financial economics**, with a particular focus on the competitive dynamics of the asset management industry and 
its implications for investors' welfare.

I will be on the 2023-2024 job market.
